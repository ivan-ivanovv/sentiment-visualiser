If Hilary in the other hand wins she will just hold the economy a little more making the bubble bigger and not to mention her health is not the best for a president.",

But honestly both had key points. only thing i can say honestly is that increasing taxes on the rich eliminates jobs just as many as it creates and we do need to charge when we use our resources to aid other nations. Sorry but freedom isnt free, other countrys are thrieving because they are adapting but sticking to tradition as well. How many people do you see becoming chinese citizens from america.",

      "[My thoughts about this] I think Trump just keeps talking and a big mouth and acts way too power hungry. Both Hillary and Trump has their faults, but by the end of this election im putting my vote on Hillary, she wont be as quick to cause wars upon nations and people we are neutral with, unlike trump, he will threaten our safety by being overly aggressive, and money hungry to act as the bigger man. Hillery at least talks about peace and prosperity, about education program being supported, more jobs, and understanding of our allies to keep along our treaty. All I can see is that Trump with him over running his mouth during big moments (if he was president) will cause an unnecessary hatred upon America and Americans (which he's already done for himself with latinos and muslims) and if he continues this he'll do the same to China and or other nations/races that we didn't need to get in a fight/war with. He thinks too much of his \"big business's and money\" as key to controlling anyone and everyone, rather he doesn't think of mutual respect and prosperity, especially if he gets overly aggressive by \"taunting\" and acts to blow them up. He'll cause wars and we need to start ending them instead of provoking fights. Im not saying Hillary is perfect, but at least with her as commander and chief of America, we'd have less chance of pissing off other nations and I believe in Hillery's economy values and what she wants for America, over what Trump is trying to say with his big business money hungry attitude. [If anyone wants to respond and debate with others, feel free too, I am not here to start unnecessary cursing and arguments. It's just my opinion and outlook about what I think about Trump and Hillary.]",

Yeah' it is in every teen movie and magically due to the power of the of Hollywood the school finally realized the queen bee has been evil all along and they all live humanly ever after.  well,  There is the other teen movie where the over passioned one killed the whole school with fire including the queen bee and her minions.....but i want the awakening to good newness kinda ending.
