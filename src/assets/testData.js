      "Still watching this, glad I didnt vote for either of them. Playing culture Club/The Cure in my mind like we used to as 80's music üéµ babies.... Please compare to the news (local and National)ect. And recordings and things- The View, Twitter (many different ideas from all different points of view and perspective of different famous people, each other that use twitter, (us ;) endless comments and convo. (Info) ect.- googleplex Youtube Channels/Blaze Tv) Democrat and Republican sources and True News like the Epoch Times üì∫during the time between the debates and the inauguration. Then rewatch the inauguration and take note of details.  Its a whole 'nother experience. God bless you to have your eyes opened and see what they half assed signaled to each other on live camera. Talk about a shadow Govt. That seemingly hidden shadow Govt. And how they publicly showed their disdain for God, even family curses, (spells ect.) Which also were televised and half assed. (Less potency of castability and strength over the minds of men/woman) If 911 was an inside job, its was surprisingly well done, compared to the laziness presented this inaugural ceremony. Meant to be a ceremony of acceptance of Presidental Power and of parties coming together, we let division eat us so many times ravenously. And it was on full display that day. If I was a part of that group I would never allow a trainwreck like that to have ever aired. If it wasnt gonna be right, call it off. Friggin logistical mess man. What the frick where they even \"Signaling\" about? Thats obviously not on the tape, but it is a completely JACKED UP inauguration. Worst one with the worst imagery of people all standing around and with all that trainwreck, I have ever winessed in my 37 years. Just like the debate, remembering it makes me want to help people soooooooooo much. Love is what we need OH GOD BLESS US FOR DISCERNMENT OH GOD! PRAISE YOU LORD! Oh GOD! - lets no mention the Bernie Meme that came of this- as if the people made fun of the trainwreck they had just viewed. Just check it all out and decide for yourself. Maybe we need to go back to our roots...... God bless you!! Always!!!",

      "I've rewatched this several times, mostly to laugh, but it's clear that Trump couldn't match wits(he kept trying and failed before this debate to paint Biden as the \"dumb, unaware\" candidate), so he basically tried to make this debate solely about Hunter Biden, as if Trump, and his family of corrupt billionaires are angels themselves. He couldn't match Biden on policy issues either, so he resorted on interruptions to disrupt the flow of the debate.That crap works on dumb Trump klan members, but not for the majority of the country.",

Trump has severely divided the country by firing up and encouraging his far-right wing supporters to go out of control and let loose of ugliness towards fellow Americans. I wonder how many of them went without their stimulus funds this Christmas season. Trump's outrageous behavior should be legally prevented from ever happening again!",

As for Trump, I think his biggest issue in this debate was that he focused too much on attacking Biden, and did so in his typical arrogant matter, while Biden showed patience, had actual plans, and TALKED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I think Trump came out uber aggressive since deep down, he knows he botched the pandemic, has no actual health care plan, and his aggression was a pathetic attempt to shield those flaws.Trump didn't talk to the people a single time...why his cult members remain loyal to him is beyond me. We're an afterthought to Trump, despite the damage he has caused.",

      "Attorney Sidney Powell of Donald Trump's legal team said they will begin placing evidence of voter fraud on a website for any citizen to verify, explaining that there is too much evidence and that they have worked hard to order it, since they intend to take it to court possibly next week. He also said that they will present the biggest and most important legal case in the history of the United States, including witnesses who because of fear for their lives will be included in the federal government's witness protection program.Video Sidney Powell:     https://twitter.com/glennbeck/status/1329874765939523585?s=20 U.S. Supreme Court Justices have reassigned the circuit courts, effective November 20, 2020.Due to this sudden change, four conservative federal Supreme Court Justices will be in charge of receiving priority or \"emergency\" cases filed with the lower courts in different circuits around the country.The most striking thing is that these circuits are in four decisive states in dispute, claimed by Donald Trump:State of Michigan (16 electoral votes):Brett M. Kavanaugh (conservative judge appointed by Trump)State of Wisconsin (10 electoral votes)Amy Coney Barrett (Conservative Judge appointed by Trump)State of Pennsylvania (20 electoral votes):Samuel A. Alito (conservative judge appointed by George W. Bush)State of Georgia (16 electoral votes) Clarence Thomas (conservative judge appointed by George H.W. Bush)There are 62 electoral votes among the four states in dispute.Supreme Court news link:https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/circuitassignments.aspx A favorable decision for Trump in one of these circuits would take the case to the Federal Supreme Court, precisely the strategy outlined by Trump's legal team.",

      "Trump, even here, is talking against masks.  Now, Faucci MIGHT have said you don't need masks at the very beginning, but they didn't know what this disease did then.  So, him saying that here, confuses people.  They THINK they can trust their president, but not this one.  He lies more than anyone else.  He lies about Biden and crowds, it just that Biden's followers are more knowledgeable and more intelligent.  They know to stay away from crowds.  I hope Georgia votes in two Democratic Senators.  Otherwise, your healthcare is gone.*** Trump needs to make up his mind, first he says, Joe wouldn't have closed us down, and 2 million would have died, then he says Joe wants to close everything down (see what's happening in Trump world; he isn't doing ANYTHING about this situation, when they SHOULD be offering school online - it can be the regular teachers at school, but the kids are at home).  Trump COULD HAVE PREVENTED THIS.  Yes, closing the border quickly was good (should have been even quicker), but undoing Obama's Fast Reacting Pandemic Plan was stupid.  It's CLEAR that epidemics/pandemic is part of our lives.  People want EVERYTHING, but they can't HAVE EVERYTHING.",

The problem is the millionaires and billionaires of the world are SO egotistical and only thinking about THEMSELVES that these politicians know that ‚Äúwe need them‚Äù just to make ends meet. If WE ALL (wealthy or not) just whole heartedly donated to EACH OTHER every month (and yes the more wealthy people could afford more) than we could really cut out the middle men (politicians). WE CAN DO THIS!!! It‚Äôs what‚Äôs called a revolving door of currency. Yes the more wealthy would receive money via cashapp/PayPal every other month too! That means NO DISCRIMINATION or Bias at all. Can we PLEASE Unify and make this happen?!? All it takes is genuine LOVE for you‚Äôre fellow human beings and ORGANIZATION with the common goal of everyone at least being COMFORTABLE. I know crime, abortions and suicide would drop so low.  If people who are in the higher tax bracket would just snap out of it and realize that YOU CANNOT TAKE ANY MONEY WITH YOU WHEN YOU DIE, than maybe, just maybe they would see HOW MANY LIVES THEY CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE instead of buying materialistic things, you‚Äôd be AMAZED at the change in the United States of America!! I know this may be a little hard to read and understand but I can break this down so simple. WE NEED EACH OTHER. EVERYONE ON EVERY LEVEL DONATES...and I BET WE WILL NOT NEED these politicians and ‚Äústimulus packages‚Äù so bad. My cashapp is $17thehogg and my email is 17thehogg@gmail.com I pray that SOMEONE or SOME PEOPLE understand. If not just email me and let‚Äôs exchange numbers and talk.

      "I like to talk about someone special, the secrete behind my new found success in my career as a developer. About a year ago I applied for a contract and was denied, It was diver-stating because I really need the contract to put my business together. I tried so hard the past few months to secure that contract but it didn't seem I was doing anything. No matter how hard I try, everything remained the same until 3 weeks ago I read an article on YouTube about a Spell caster and Cure expert who helped someone secured a Job within a week. I was amazed and I immediately called and told him about the contract and my business. He promised to help me but I was a bit skeptical because I had lost all hope on getting that contract and saving my business. I did everything he asked of me and he assured me I would get that contract and my business back on track in less than a week. Behold to my greatest surprise, I was called and awarded the contract and my business is up and running. I'm grateful to Dr. Olalekan who made this possible. You can reach him on email: olalekanspell@gmail.com or Whatsapp; +2349050071327. I'm sure you wont be disappointed",

      "Trump is a very influential person to his supporters, so when he mocks the officials, tries to discredit Fauci and others who are experts in the field of epidemiology by deliberately taking them out of context, his hot box joyride during his infectious stage, as well as setting a precedent where he blatantly refuses to follow all aspects of CDC protocol from wearing masks to social distancing, etc,  during his rallies to white house events, etc, then yes, he can be held responsible simply because of the perceived power the supporters who follow his example and have of him. Trump has deliberately flouted science, social distancing and made a mockery of masks, refusing to wear a mask in situations where it was deemed necessary by hospital authorities and medical consultants. We are on our second White-house outbreak, will this administration ever learn?During the onset of COVID-19 Trump repeatedly lied to the American people about the severity of the virus, repeatedly thumbing his nose in the face of science with ridiculous pseudoscience claims that could potentially endanger others, over 200,000 American citizens are now dead with the numbers climbing due to his inaction. Statistics were not on Trumps side as he openly encouraged people to attend rallies without social distancing and other protective measures in place. He's now tested positive with the all too real possibility that prior to diagnosis, of having spread the virus to countless others through his selfishness and willful ignorance of scientific evidence, he continues to behave in a way that encourages the transmission of the Covid-19 virus. Trump has brought this upon himself and he only has himself to blame due to his own arrogance and hubris. It's not the past lies that is the issue, but the fact is; in the future everything Trump states will be suspect and questioned just like the words of Conley, his supposed \"Doctor\", there is nothing transparent about that administration, the trust has long been destroyed and Pence helped drive the nail in the coffin of his Vice Presidential term. When the interim president continues ad nauseam with passive-aggressive misogynistic sentiments, ad hominem attacks, abject condescension, thinly veiled racism, the use of pseudoscience, conspiracy theories and weak arguments based on unfounded assumptions catering to confirmation biases, this shows a desperate grasp to remain relevant while having nothing new to contribute to the nation as a whole.  Biden's idea to eliminate fossil fuels WILL NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT, this takes many many years, at least several presidential terms to get a healthy start on this! Proper infrastructure must be in place to facilitate the changeover, the right is pandering to fear, it's horrible to take advantage of a person's fear for their jobs and well being. The relationships that Biden has forged are necessary to start the process. Let's support the changeover from fossil fuels, there will be a time when out resources will start to run out and when that happens we will be prepared. Together across party lines we can achieve great things together.  Let's end the division and be a nation that is strong together once again.~~~~~~Is another four years of chaos, lies and deception from the TRUMP/PENCE Administration what we deserve as American Citizens?~~~~~Please elect Biden and Harris to repair the damage done to our global reputation! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Criminal Indictments by Administration~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Jimmy Carter -- ONE~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Bill Clinton -- TWO~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~George W. Bush  -- SIXTEEN~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Richard Nixon  -- SEVENTY-SIX~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Ronald Reagan-- ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-EIGHT~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Donald Trump (so far)  -- TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The Barack Obama Administration -- ZERO~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",

You do not want a candidate to win only to be replaced by his Vice President in a matter of days if not months. Keep your eyes peeled by their actions not by their talk.",

I am ashamed of other countries seeing our prez behavior. Trump's personality SUCKS BIG TIME!! he's definately been a bully all his life and obviously hasn't grown up and out of it. No integrity either, takes tantrums . This is no way to make the american people proud of our prez,  just the opposite, embarassing!!!!!!!!!",

Trump just being Trump should have been an advantage but dodging questions and not giving solid concrete answers only puts Biden on an even plain field with Trump and with that, I think Trump might just remain president. Question is, is keeping the president and things the same good or the possibility of someone being the same or worse worth the gamble. Biden says Trump doesn't have a plan, but what's Biden's plan anyway? We need to someone who is gonna care about this or will have the right policies in place to cater to the people, but what are those plans? what are the policies? what are the things we need? If we need a tool to tighten a bolt, is it just a tool? does this tool have a name? Do you know of this tool? is it a socket or a wrench? Just a tool doesn't sound like you're saying everything Biden. You look like a well behave version of Trump, Biden. AOC seem to be more direct. Why isn't she running for president? As a guy that have mixed feelings on a woman running the country, AOC seems to have way more than what it takes to run this country considering what we already have and the current face of the opposition.",

      "Americans need to wake up and really fast, this is getting way out of hand and I hate to say that most Americans that are following the democrats are ignorant, for the ones that do not realize and take offence to me saying that ignorant means that you are not very knowledgeable as to the democrats, you are uneducated to that aspect, I give you the meaning because some will say I am calling them a name or saying a bad thing when in fact I am not, I just need everyone to understand what I am saying and know that what I say is true, its not an opinion, it is facts that are backed up by history and by facts that are public knowledge that for some reason not many people want to actually look at and research. All this being said I have researched and I have looked at all the public information that I can and what I found is the following that is 1000% accurate. The Democrats for starters have a very long history of being racist and that goes back to the time when they formed, the Democrats were not very pleased when Lincoln freed the slaves so they had him assassinated by none other then a democrat, the vice President at that time was a democrat and once he took over he tried along with the other democrats help to go back on what Lincoln had accomplished and it failed thanks to the Republicans whom had just enough votes in chambers with some persuading. The democrats created the KKK and even today they still have members of their party that are active, Robert C Bird that was a Grand Dragon with the KKK and proud supporter spent his life and actually died while still serving in congress, he has bridges , buildings and roads named after him throughout WV yet he was a man of evil doing against the black communities. The Democrats have a lot more members with the same similarities scattered throughout America. They are supporters of planned parenthood that was created by democrats back in the day under Margaret Sanger, I suggest you take a look at her interviews and why they are in support of Abortion or shall I say why they actually started Abortions, the interviews are public information and you just have to look them up under her name. They started Abortions to try and cause the Black population to decrease by killing the black American Children so the race would eventually die off, or shall I say that was the plan and Sanger is not at all afraid to say that in her interviews of coarse they use the N word for their reference. They have fought against all civil rights movement and any legislation that went before them and still today do the same. I know you might say well they have black Americans in office and Joe Biden just picked a Black woman as his running mate yet you do not think of the fact that they are doing nothing but using the black Americans to try and gain power, look back at a year ago and see the debate that his running mate had with him before she dropped out of race for president , she exposed old Joe for what he is and how he was a racist,  the thing is everyone forgets that and they know this because people do not see to care. The real funny thing is no one wanted her as president a year ago but now a year later everyone does not think about old Joe dying in office and her taking the helm. Now we have a man that has been accused of sexually Assaulting his coworker running for President and he picks a black woman to use to try and get elected a woman that no one wanted a year ago and its okay? They shut his accuser up by one of two things they either threatened her and her family or paid very well. I do not get why someone would take money and forget something like that so I will assume she was threatened. Now on with more. The Black lives movement gets donations through their website and this is in the millions and should be going to help black lives and communities but NO it goes to all white democrats like Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders , Elizabeth Warren with millions received and the list goes on. This organization is ran by democrats as well as Antifa and they are paid and organized among them that are causing all these issues. Ask yourself why only certain parts of the country are having problems and not the rest? This is because they believe they can swing the blame onto Trump in these areas and swing that vote for these states because they need them to win the presidency.  They are using all the Americans period and the sad part is its going to cause a civil unrest that has not been seen since the civil war, Americans fighting Americans and they could really care less and why you might ask because they are evil and honestly they do not want Americans to be free anymore they want complete control and a lot are falling for it. The democrats sell Americans out to other countries and this is exactly what they plan. We can stop them and we will stop them. Do some research and you will see for yourself. Whom do you think dropped the ballots from the mail in a ditch in PA , all of these were for Trump. The demons aka Democrats are not going to let this be a fair election, they will continue to cheat and do what ever they can to try and take control and we the American people that believe in a fair election process and believe that we are one nation under God and want to be able to keep our rights and freedoms have got to stop  them from destroying our country that men and woman have fought and died to protect throughout history, we will not let them take over , we will fight and we will win against this evil. God   bless and love you all. I pray for everyone and I pray for our country.https://youtu.be/L3zG3g2ARLg",

      "Nancy is blocking the stimulus bill because she doesn‚Äôt want Trumps‚Äô name on it. She has stated this on record and it‚Äôs been read back to her countless times. It‚Äôs clear she will not pass a new stimulus  bill until AFTER the election. This is outrageous, people are literally loosing everything and some can‚Äôt eat and yet Nancy Pelosi will not even compromise. When Obama was resident Nancy spoke directly to Obama during Obama‚Äôs stimulus bill back in the ‚Äúhousing‚Äù crash. She refuses to even call trump to negotiate so that a bill can be passed and people can eat. Things are getting out in the open folks let‚Äôs get ready. Twitter and Facebook are being subpoenaed to answer for their election interference. They blocked the Biden - Hunter story because they want Biden to win. Every American should be paying attention to this one. Joe Biden is a Meir puppet, need proof? Go to YouTube and search Joe Biden teleprompter, that‚Äôs all the proof you need. He has ‚Äúinterviews‚Äù via zoom etc where the questions he is asked is scripted and his answered are given to him via teleprompter. Now the whole point to have scripted questions is so you know the questions and therefore can be prepared with a crisp answer. This guy Joe Biden has scripted questions and reads the answers from a teleprompter and he STILL can‚Äôt get it correct. The Point for the second half of this video is to show ‚Äúat a surface level‚Äù anyhow that the media has been complicit in helping Joe with his plan and agenda and they give Trump nothing. Crazy times stay blessed and YouTube Joe Biden Teleprompter get the algorithms up so more people can see Joe‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs True mouthpiece. He is lost without a teleprompter this is not a leader this is a puppet it cannot be more open and apparent. Much love to everyone. Trump or Biden please do your research and choose wisely. No matter your choice you are loved.",

They need to do the record keeping themselves and relentlessly promote it.It needs to be hammered home over and over and over, every single day and every single week, along w/ messaging about **what** is being done to correct things and the **progress** being made in each area.Every single impediment or obstruction the Republicans throw in their path along the way needs to be mercilessly called out repeatedly as a blocker. Any concessions or compromise or good behavior on the part of Republicans should be acknowledged and praised too.The messaging needs to be \"We've been left with a complete mess from this disaster of a presidency and Republican-led Senate...here is the hole we are in and how far along we are towards getting ourselves back to break even\"",

      "The debate mention of the idea of ANTIFA, merely meaning anti-fascism is a propagandized idea with the goal of blaming those whom elitists wish to rid themselves of because we are becoming a greed based problem. When a people, A NATION of people, cannot survive their is a natural reaction. ANTIFA is merely the natural reaction of survival.  When you control the nations riches, it‚Äôs money, it‚Äôs means of survival, you control people‚Äôs reactions and beliefs.  And so this becomes the elitism last resort to invest in - humanity.  We can‚Äôt have the concept of fascism, when a nations poor lower middle to lower classes keep getting poorer.  This is an oxymoron unless the plans are set to turn a Constitutional nation and turn into a private nation, an aristocracy. The fascism is an ‚Äúanything goes concept‚Äù void of any form of governing body. It aims to take advantage of and intimidate impoverished segments of that nation‚Äôs poor, needy, its perceived, undesirable and demonize them and then bring them out into the streets, blame them and assassinate them. This has the potential of becoming a new modern day holocaust. This is the Confederacy rising up again. It‚Äôs a private nation refusing to become a Constitutional nation. An example of ‚Äúanything goes‚Äù is slavery and how fascism evolves to survival of the fittest style, predatorial society.     This leads to Christianity and Religion traditionally falling into persecution. Republicans know one thing MONEY and GREED as the CORE governing concept. This is simply put corruption and decay as its end result, and even an occult concept.     University political science professors, influential representatives need to step up and educate the public now, clout and influence is needed before ignorance follows this path even further. These concepts are built into the pathos of Trump and the party‚Äôs political wants. Elitism is what makes him and many like him pathologically inclined and empty hearted. This is Satan‚Äôs Pathos, the money root of all evil, riches rots a man‚Äôs heart and leaves a nations needy out to survive and fend for themselves. Fascism runs in Trump‚Äôs vains without him even knowing it‚Äôs meaning and ideology. It is pathological greed AT ANY COST...you and I in the millions amounts to they‚Äôre survival. This is the beginnings of a modern holocaust.",

      "Nobody seems to ask why the Germans were so excited about supporting Hitler and the Nazi's in WWII. Those that are not familiar with history are doomed to relive it. In only four years, America has been nearly destroyed by this man and his corrupt cronies. Jump on the Trump ultra-conservative, extreme-right bandwagon if you want to, but Trump the fake president -- Trump the Groper -- has nearly destroyed the nation in four years. I can't congratulate people on losing their ways and becoming mindless Trumpites who drank the Trump Kool-Aid. It takes a lot of grit to hold your own when the storms start stirring around you. Trump is no leader. He is only a pretender. America deserves better than what they have suffered under the heavy hand of the extreme ultra-conservative far-right. I have lived through 12 presidencies, and Trump's is the worst I have ever seen. Wake up and smell the coffee, America. You have a  chance to take back your country in November. I am a proud patriotic American, and I vote!",

      'The way this man see\'s¬†"Wearing a mask is an act of hate, as the wearer is judging and accusing others of being or possibly being "contaminated" and enemies and therefore worthy of violence to be inflicted upon them in order to be "disinfected," or killed if necessary, for "the good of humanity." Most people are not capable of thinking so deeply, but this is really what\'s happening with this doctrine. Further, others are not allowed to not believe in germ theory doctrine and are forced to believe it or be ridiculed or, once again, be met with some sort of violence. So here we have it - judgmentalism, false accusations, intolerance, and hatred. To delve a little deeper, germ theory is simply repackaged disease-causing evil spirit theory where only a few "enlightened" ones are skilled in the anti-science craft of supposedly seeing the alleged infectious agents with special equipment that only they have access to. Essentially germ theory is a religious hate doctrine, and mask-wearing is a religious act. I, therefore, reject the religious command of mask-wearing because said religious command violates my religion." let the courts begin against, hate crimes are as a crime.',

Kennedy was the last legal president in this Country, I believe that Richard Nixon and his gang conspired to murder John F. Kennedy, and they bribed the CIA and the FBI to cover that crime up, and to have a fake president in the U.S., and I believe that Nixon's gang murdered someone in the former National U.S. Treasury Department in Washington D.C., which is right by the White House, and they bribed the CIA and the FBI to cover that crime up to, and to put the taxes from the IRS in the Morgan Stanley Bank in Washington D.C., the federal taxes did go to the National U.S. Treasury Department until about 1964, after 1964 the federal taxes have went to the Morgan Stanley Bank in Washington D.C., and there was a printing press there at the National U.S. Treasury Department that printed money, and I believe Nixon's gang stole some money from that U.S. Treasury Department in the 60's, and all of the presidents after that have been illegal presidents, and I believe that some of those illegal presidents or all of them bribed a lot of the U.S. military workers jobs to quit their jobs and bribed some gang criminals to be illegal U.S. military workers, and Mary Stanley's gang bribed the rest of the U.S. military workers to quit their jobs, and her gang bribed some gang criminals from her gang to be illegal U.S. military workers, with stolen money from the Federal government bank accounts and the U.S. Treasury Department in Manhatten New York, and I believe that Barack Obama's gang could of murdered the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury Department in Manhatten New York in about 2004, and Barack Obama's took over that U.S. Treasury Department in about 2004 and bribed the CIA and the FBI to cover up those crimes.",

      "Even if I believed President Trump has done a bad job with Covid-19, this democrat would DEFINITELY NOT BE VOTING FOR BIDEN! And it was President Trump that BANNED travel from CHINA (January 31st) and on the Same Day that BIDEN called it 'Hysterical Xenophobic.' Really? It was was President Trump that Banned travel from Europe about a month later to limit the spread of the virus and he got called out again. Really? Meanwhile Nancy Pelosi was inviting people to CHINA Town in her home state of California as late as February 24th (when there were already 15 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the U.S.). Joe is For: Open Borders (and it was the Obama-BIDEN administration that created the so-called 'kennels' (really just fenced in areas) at the Southern Border NOT the Trump administration). Joe is For: Riots in our streets and that is what they are -- peaceful protests (like MLK) happened in the light of day NOT the cover of darkness - when arson, looting, & assault happens. LAW & ORDER. period - without it - nothing else is possible. Plus Eric Garner, Michael Brown - these police brutality events happened during the Obama/BIDEN administration -- where was the outcry then? Plus I am not voting for a \"pay for play\" (selling out our country with our enemies - China & Iran - so his son can make a fortune), Plus I am not voting for a dementia patient that is listening to the radical left that wants to turn our country to SOCIALISM. TRUMP 2020!! for this democrat.",

      "Who really is still grappling with race issues in 2020? Other than White people. Blacks and Liberals have become the biggest racist in America. And the Demoncrats are using it as an Election tool. Both sides are not to he wholeheartedly trusted, during any election. But the past few seasons of this soap opera have been heavy on the dems pushing racism for the views(votes). Don't get me wrong, the System has worked it's magic on the Black Communities. Fatherless homes, incentives for single mothers, diminished educational systems in lower income neighborhoods, etc. Joe Biden and The Witch of the West Hillary can attest to that. But the Democratic plantation is a free will Plantation. No actual fences, just incentivesüòâ. If your Black and for Biden. You don't want to see our communities rise to a respectable level. No one should want to portray their live as being a Victim, unless you can attach an actual perpetrator to it. Unless you just feel less of person being Black. If so, thats on you. Keep the Country out of it",

I understand that many are out of work, but did anyone realize that 700,000 more people are applying for Unemployment benefits. What does that tell you? We are shutting down slowly and no one is realizing it. Save your money because its only going to get worst. Many more will die, and more people will be lay-off and more businesses will close down.

He is fraudsters. I'm simply surprised he says on presidential election yes I know ways to not pay tax. He pays 750 dollars. Americans are you nieve???? 3.) Climate change, he knows nothing about it. 4.) His health care plan : Clown doesn't have any plan.... He just blabbers. 5.) Handling of Covid pandemic. He failed miserably, worst leader in the world with such good resources he has. Even the 3rd World Country with less resources have done better. 6.) Clown only worries about his business and family not Americans.... If he cares he cares only white people. 7.) His disrespect to the moderator, fellow President candidate, bullying attitudes, interruptions.8.) He talks about military power then why didn't he go after North Korea or China who bullying half of Asian countries like Taiwan, India, Philippines and America in South China Sea.AMERICANS THINK ABOUT YOUR NEXT GENERATION AND VOTE OUT THIS CLOWN, RACIST, ANTI-FEMINIST, LIAR, Fraudster.Worst President Ever.",

I wasn‚Äôt an Obama supporter for POTUS but like Obama as a person and find him and his wife very charming. Anyway, I will say that I might finally understand close to what Trump haters feel bc I absolutely abhor that other candidate bc I would HATE for him to be potus and have ANY female within feet from him bc he is a disgusting, inappropriate child molester that gives me the absolute creeps!! That‚Äôs just him as a person, never mind his capabilities as president. What a disaster! If he‚Äôs potus, I guarantee he‚Äôll turn all his supporters against him if they risk visiting him with their little girls, teens, or even semi-attractive wives ü§¢ü§Æ",

People make mistakes and everything that's going on right now, sometimes it can't be helped. No more calling the Coronavirus \"China Virus\" or \"Chinese Virus.\" It's COVID-19.

      "The best debate format to equalize both parties arguments and yet giving an equal opportunity to both parties for replying, it is the following format:  1. When the speaker is talking about the proposed subject, the other party mic is always off - 2. After the 2 minutes, there will be one minute for the other party to reply the speaker. -  3. Finally it will be given one minute to the original speaker to answer the reply. This cycle will be applied to each contender. 4. You must always have an even number of proposed subjects.  Further more, just hope and pray.",

Now, it's easy to see that America is ready for a second round.The truth is that NO country is immune to populism; Britain is there to prove it.",

In the past we did not have the technology, twitter, electronic email, computers with constant news, etc.  and therefore the debates when formed back 60 plus year ago were good. However, today it appears to be merely a formality some what archaic similar to newspapers and magazines.",

His body language, his tone of voice was cold and irresponsible. His way was to cut Biden of at every turn and lie constantly in hope that nobody was listening to Biden's arguments.You either need to be naive or very cynical and cold as Trump to support him.Trump is a pathological liar, that is just a fact!He is the definition of a dictator in the making.We all know what the devil does to the people closest to him, he will sell his voters' to the dictator who bid the highest.  After this debate I know, it is a real possibility that Trump is mentally prepared to make a coup. To the American people remember we are each other's keepers, Meaning we need to keep each other accountable for our words and our actions.Trump is no different, he is just a man.Please go out and vote for the man with the most empathy! The world desperately needs it!",

      'I want to highlight that: "I did not pay taxes, like every smart person who is no fool." Taxes are paid so that a country can run. And a country are its people. If you say: "You are smart, you kept more for yourself than you gave to the group." You are not part of that group and you do not care for that group.If everybody who pays the taxes they should are fools - yeah - then why do we have countries? For what - what is this good for?What is the consequence?  Arm up warlords and live the utopian dream? Create your own group as group "country" is only for fools? If we would live in the medieval time - you say such a thing - it would have been the last thing you have said. Julius Ceasar wrote about how the Swiss killed a guy including his whole party, as he did something like that and tried to resist trial. It is on the first pages of DBG.No that is not human if you try  to prevent taxes. It looks like you comit no harm because of civilization and we are not living anymore in one valley, but you do. You hurt your group. Period.',

      "trump continues to try  to prosecute Biden about  something Biden did not do in 40 years.  Will someone please  introduce to his small brain , the  many lies that have rolled off his tongue, that has caused major damage, that has devastated not only our country, but the lives of so many  Americans. Did he denounce the white supremacist  group ?? He COULDN'T and he WOULD NOT, because that would breach his contract of honor with David dukes. How can you trust someone who believes  in his own lies?  trump is a racist.  It is repeatedly quoted, that IF IT WALKS LIKE A DUCK, QUACKS LIKE A DUCK AND LOOKS LIKE A DUCK.  I'll leave you to complete this saying.  Biden is absolutely right!!  Please  hurry to ask trump the question about the white supremacists . Why won't you people take heed and listen to what  Joe Biden is unfolding to you.  Again I ask for your undivided attention.  trump is definitely associated with white  supremacist. He has established strong ties with David dukes.  This non-political racist of a person , should be treated like the Hitler that he idolizes to become.",

And just listening to the Covid segment, the numbers cannot be accurate. There is no viable proof that Covid is as infectious as it is, and even if it was, the measures that were taken were clearly not working and not appropriate for the circumstance. This is the most disgraceful thing I have seen. Next election, there should be a moderator that both sides can agree on and can do so fairly. There is my rant for the day.",

      "Mr President, have you heard of toastmasters? They teach you the appropriate way to do public speaking, adhere to time constraints, and not to berate your adversary. There's a way to get your point across without being disrespectful to Mr Biden and the moderator....especially the moderator. Clearly, Sir, you've never been an athlete who played a sport where referees controlled the game. You threaten, argue or hit a referee, you're ejected. By the way, why did you even mention bringing back Big 10 football during your covid response question? People are dying, starving, going broke, still unemployed, struggling to stay healthy, keep small businesses afloat, but you brought Big 10 football back.....because that's all that is important? It was curious to me that you would mention Big 10 football as the jewel in your covid response crown....not helping businesses or the people. Not getting another stimulus package signed and passed anytime soon that doesn't directly benefit your approval rating just before an election. Talking over people, calling them stupid, making fun of their children on national TV is not a debate, it's an embarrassment to the position you currently hold, Sir. The president is held to a higher standard than everyone, and not be someone who bullies anyone who disagrees with him, and tries to frustrate and distract  others until they just give up because they're tired of your antics. What kind of honorable win is that? It's not an honorable win if your opponent is not at 100% when you persevere over them. No victory is worth celebrating if you didn't 100% earn it.",

This is a typical person you would have an unhealthy relationship with, someone who should be in therapy but are unable to see their own faults and unwilling to accept others point of view or feelings. They are unable to care about others in a way that doesn't benefit them. This is not someone who should be in a power position.",

The U.S. economy and winning. Was a bit cringe his refusal to denounce white supremacist, but he has been born and raised in such a way that it would require him to denounce his family and supporters, not to mention himself.Biden didnt show any more presidential self control either with the calling of a president a \"clown\" he's just a much more passive person. On the other hand I don't believe Trump was flustered much, just looks like he was being humself with his obnoxious, personality. If this was a boxing match, Trump won this one with a few deductions. Yeah make sure to mute or lower mic volume for obnoxious interruptions next time, everyone must be heard. This was too one sided.",

They're both clowns they're both too old to both act too much like children it also makes the rest of the government act like children as in congressman representatives speakers all of them they all  act like children. Trump is such a liar. I can't stand to see him let alone hear him. I hope and pray that Trump will read this and put a voice of truth in his mouth because I'm a United States citizen and I know how he runs this country is deplorable.

      "To be honest, I feel sorry for the youngest voters who JUST got allowed to vote. We are talking about first-time voters who might be genuinely curious about what each party had to say with regards to various contentious and controversial issues and what each party believes is the best for the country. But they don't even get that - the 1.5h debate was basically a fruitless all-out cafeteria fight with words that says nothing on what each party has to offer. I hope that future debates will be more fruitful than this one. That was a long 1.5h catfight that no one needed to see.",

      "Senator Bernard Sanders is by far a better pick than former Vice-President Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. I believe after hearing the debates between all the Democratic party members as well as the Republican party most folks would agree. In fact, after watching the 2020 debates between President Donald John Trump and former Vice-PresidentJoseph Robinette Biden Jr. , most folks would agree that neither candidate‚Äôs intelligence mental capacity can be compared with Senator Bernard Sanders. Whenever the public hear or watch Senator Sanders talk about the major crisis America is experiencing, and the ideal potential policies that could resolve disputes and crisis, he actually response and sounds like he knows what he is talking about. But if you watch the first the 2020 debates between President  Trump and former Vice-President Biden, you almost could tell base on their response they kind of sound they don‚Äôt know what they are talking about, it appears as if they struggle to answer questions, and almost as if they are reciting a written script from their memory. And I did not watch the debate to be informed because I knew neither candidate would be a fresh new person I wanted to impress me, but  and no disrespect, I watched the debate because I knew I would get a good laugh between President Trump and former Vice-President Biden. Senator Sanders political background appears to be more cleaner than Vice-President Biden and President Trump. Moreover, according to an article published on Tuesday, March 03, 2020 byCommon Dreams On Super Tuesday and Beyond, 10 Reasons to Vote for Bernie Sanders: 1)Sanders consistently  polls best vs Trump. And Sanders can crush Trump among independent voters.2) Sanders has impressive  track record of accomplishment, getting tons of legislation and funding enacted via amendment.On the most critical issue of our time, climate change, Bernie Green New Deal is far stronger and more far-reaching than any other candidate plan.4) Sanders  has led the way on Medicare for All, since 2016. He helped write Obama‚Äôs Affordable Care Act, and successfully pushed through an amendment delivering $11 billion in funds for community health centers nationwide.5) Sanders has led the fight for a $15 federal minimum wage for years, and persuaded Amazon to pay its workers $15/hour.6) Most unions, including nurses, teachers, and postal workers, are backing Sanders because he has by far the strongest record of fighting for workers and unions--it's not even close.7) Sanders  opposed NAFTA and while Biden backed the extremely harmful neoliberal trade deal. This was a key issue that Trump used to defeat Hillary Clinton in Rust Belt states like Ohio and Michigan. Bernie is the unrivaled candidate for fair trade.8)Although I am a Christian, Sanders has definitely stood up and fought for LGBTQ rights since the early 1980s as Burlington Mayor, and put his body on the line for civil rights in the early 1960s. Sanders opposed the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996, while Biden supported it. Sanders has the longest clearest track record of fighting for equality and justice. He has always strongly backed the ERA and women's right to choose. He has ALWAYS stood up and fought for civil and human rights and justice. Always.9) More than anyone else running, Sanders  is bringing people together a multiracial coalition that leads among African American, Latinx, and Asian American voters. Polls have consistently shown that Sanders leads nationally and strongly among Latinx, Black, and Asian American voters.10) Sanders  has opposed military expansionism and war, while Biden (and Warren to some extent) have supported runaway military spending hikes and U.S. invasions. Sanders is the only candidate who challenges Israel‚Äôs brutal treatment of Palestine. It‚Äôs way past time for a fundamental shift in U.S. foreign policy, and Sanders is the only candidate with a clear track record of challenging the destructive war machine and military-industrial complex which are crippling domestic progress while causing havoc and harm abroad.‚ÄùRegardless if you‚Äôre a Democrat or Republican, I believe Senator Bernie Sanders should have been picked. No disrespect indented even though I mean what I commented. And to be realistic I love and support candidates who are just like Bernie Sanders and former President Barack Obama regardless if you‚Äôre a Democrat or Republican. üôèüèæ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèæ",

Donald Trump refused to condemn white national racists on a global stage last night when asked to do so. Therefore, Donald Trump is a racist. If you knowingly vote for a racist you are promoting racism and that shows that either directly, or by  omission you are a racist. These are simply facts. I have opinions about these facts,  but they are neither important or relevant... I am not thrilled with the Democratic platform or the candidate. But I am certainly not a racist that promotes racism.",

      "American mayors, governors, and White house never have  failed to deal with the virus that is newtype virus. Look Sweden's state: never closes business, but over 88 % of deaths relating to the virus were so old whose ages are over 70 year old, and only one person under 20 year oldwas killed, 1 among 5808 [in the end of Aug.20 ].  Interestingly, this year's death rate is likely lowerthan last year's [the figures can be fought in internet ]. This suggests health and young people have little risk being hurt.Yet, unquestionably, even without the virus, no one is able to live forever.while the virus' disappearing completely, we are able to conclude what type strategy is better to deal with  the virus. Politicians should not ignore Sweden's state, and fully reopening USA is to benefit grassroots---rich people without working can have money!! Politicians are likely not to pay attention to math figures. What type science can contradict math rule??",

      "Law and Order!! That‚Äôs the biggest issue right now. We need a president that‚Äôs going to help keep us safe and that means keep our police funded. Joe Biden wants to defund the police because of a few bad cops in the system. I feel for all the family‚Äôs who have lost someone from racial acts but defunding the police isn‚Äôt how you end racism. Coming together and showing the American people that both party‚Äôs care about them, not just about the power they will gain at the end of elections. Trump is trying to help and show these people and there family‚Äôs that there life did mean something to him and everyone else, while Joe Biden is using it as political gain. Peaceful protest isn‚Äôt running around killing and tearing up private property, thats what Joe Biden and the rest of the democrats want. Joe Biden will ruin this country and it shows in every single speech he gives.",

      "I feel like this debate is funny, non-presidential. But on my own opinion or side. Donald Trump stated facts, defending himself which was a good one. However, Joe Biden tried some facts, Donald Trump even tho he is interrupting Biden, he knows that Biden is hiding some things from the American people. In my opinion, even if I don't like Donald Trump, Donald Trump will win which I'll be ok with. My friend said to me that: \"If Biden becomes president, my job will be messed up, but if Trump is president, my job will be perfect.\" My friend also said that Biden was racist which will loose him some votes.  About the COVID-19, Trump did state in his news, new updates will be coming soon, introducing us to the scientists, doctors who are working to find a cure to this Corona Virus.  In other youtube channels, they talk about Trump alot and give few media which I agree with and gives Biden good press. Even tho I support the Democrats, Trump's statement was correct. Another issue and immature thing will watching this and looking at the comments were how Trump interrupted Former Vice President Joe Biden which is not proffessional and is immature. The Obama care is good even if they prices and expensive, you do not need to remove the Obama care, howeverm you cab just easily reduce them, agreeing to terms, signing a formal document.   Banning China may seem also racist but, those who are in the US are innocent, if you can take this to the news and tell them. Then, your votes may rise up.  Another thing is that, the main-in voting is a really bad idea, me as a Student in High school who likes computer science encourages that the voting should be done on a website. And now, onto Biden, even if I liked him and trusted, he does deny some correct facts which he isn't supposed to do. The vaccinnes are first to be found by checking which animal causes them, then transmits to Humans, once do that, collect blood samples, try to re-engineer them, test it on an infected animal, possibly a primate. Then if it is successful, we can try to on a man. 1 man, 1 woman, a child aswell. From part of New York I have seen, New York already hates Trump and I understand that, but in my own opinion, they should re-think about it, look at the causes and how it is meant to be followed. Let's look at John Locke, an Enlightened Despot who encouraged, expressed the idea of the common sense to the communist, Voltaire, encouraging the American Revolution. Trump said and promised he will make America great again. Tho, America is still in a bad condition, another question that the Moderator should ask Both Donald Trump and Joe Biden about flights, international flights, domestic flights. Plans and how should the CDC plan them, give suggestions as well. Donald Trump saying: \"Do not ever use than word on me, smart\" which is also immature and unpresidential. About they want to shutdown is true, however, Governor Cuomo as been trying his best to keep New York, and possibly help other states to be open. I personally think that Donald J. Trump should meet with Andrew Cuomo and discuss more problems, debate and come with a conclusion, a bill. That will have a positive effect on the US economy and the public. Donald Trump stating about masks is ok, but the only problem about Joe Biden that when it was his turn, he started going off-topic. Donald Trump is a successful business man. His father was rich, he got the money. About the economy, I agree with Trump and the Moderator that Economy is rising, business are opening under CDC guidelines, private ownerships. I disagree with Jode Biden about fewer jobs, due to me hearing and people arguing that Trump opened Jobs for people, many people are working is ok and he is helping this country. Schools are being opened because Education is very important, schools are being opened under CDC guidelines, any one who has COVID-19 in school, they school will shutdown for a week or two, sanitize the whole school. Although, Joe Biden still has my vote, even if none of them deserves to be president at all, Thankyou(I hope this helps). Biden should be president, although he needs to change. Also last point is that Donald Trump was childish, immature and not proffessional, Biden was calm, like what a good president would be like.My name is Ken. If you would like to conact me, either email me at knze2006@gmail.com or call me at  +1 332 201 3195. Email me at knze2006@yahoo.com.",

      "THIS IS SO SAD, SO SO SAD, I am sorry but if anyone out there knows Scripture (the Bible) they will know exactly what is going on here.  God said many, many times in scripture, show me all your wise men and I show you FOOLS!!!!  Joe I feel tried, but with Trump and his attention deficit disorder he obviously is unable to hear anyone else but himself, this is what you get when you choose a president to run a country where there are also poor people, how can he understand-he was raised telling others what to do because of his family's financial situation, they don't know how govern a country with different levels of financial differences.  I am so sorry but I am sure there are many smart republicans and they should be embarrassed they have picked a man with the brain of a spoiled child.  Look I am not at all worried, what they do wont affect me either way, but they will be humbled under God just the same, If I was them that would worry me plenty since according to their age judgment for them is around the corner.  I will pray for them, they need it, I am more blessed then they will ever be, since Christ is my King and my Lord.  Let fools be fools.",

      "The person I felt bad for the most was the moderator. You could tell just how frustrated he was with Trumps constant interruptions and not letting Biden get a word in. I learned not to interrupt people while they talk when I was in elementary school, and I find that extremely rude. Little kids have a tendency to do that a lot, but adults should know better. Also, Trump addressing Biden as Joe was also disrespectful. I‚Äôm sure that in his youth he was taught that people who aren‚Äôt friends and don‚Äôt know each other in any kind of social sense should not call each other by their first names. Biden would not necessarily be a better president. He just has better manners.",

There should be a point deducted each player gets 10 points to begin.

      'Fairness in Presidential Debate  Campaign : My personal opinion.  Americans are smart people, yet they are not that "smart" are shown in this debate. They can\'t even organize an open debate in a proper manner.My personal opinion is that current "president" is so rude in behavior. He always interrupts the debate. The president always hijacks the speaking time of his opponent. He does not allow his opponent time to speak and answer the questions. The "organizer" of this debate should learn from previous debate between Hillary and Trump that one of the speakers was not well behavior and not respecting debating rules. Interrupting debate, hijacking opponent speaking is time is an exposure of his underlying personal character. To the organizer / moderator of this debate, I would express that it is an unfair debate. The speaker who is following the rule is hijacked and deprived of. This is an not a fair debate.I have great respect for Americans who are advance in many fields. Over the other hand, I am quite surprise they (the organizer of this debate) can\'t  set up a proper and "Fair" debate. They have not learn from previous mistake or shortcoming. The same mistakes happens again and again.To my American friends and the organizer of the debate, the solution is very simple (no rocket science) :You just need to fix an electronic  on/off  switching device. The moderator can switch off the sound system of the microphone, so the voice of the "culprit"  can be blocked with ease. In this way, the two minutes speaking time can be enforced easily also. To my American friends & the Organizer, this "short coming" can be rectified easily with installation of a simple electronic device - just do it !To fair to both speakers-American spirit !  Love you all !',

      "Trump is the first president in decades not to get the US involved in a war. Trump has been nominated for THREE Nobel peace prizes because of his historic, unprecedented peace deals in the Middle East. Under Trump the economy has boomed unlike it has in  decades (on a personal note my 401 K went made a 25% gain under Trump. 10% is considered good! Its NEVER done so well!) On the other hand Dems (not republicans) are rioting, looting and killing in the streets of our cities and towns. Its Dems that have defunded  police departments (even Minneapolis' own city council members seem to recognize that was a horrible mistake now that the crime rate has sky rocketed after they did so).   It's the democrat run states that have had all the coronavirus nursing home debacles that account for 40% of all coronavirus deaths in the US! To me Trump has been THE best president in my lifetime (43 years) and will go down in history as one of the best presidents ever. The choice is clear TRUMP 2020!!!",

      'Biden & Kamala (Biden Horrible time). Biden is a joker puppet. You news anchors, reporters, and commentators are being one sided. The Democratic Missouri senator McCaskill saying "unfair to Joe Biden" is ludicrous. NBC should have also featured the two current Republican senators for Missouri, Josh Hawley and Roy Blunt, for their comments. Addition Chris Wallace was clearly favoring Joe Biden in his subjective moderation. Sure, Trump was not entirely playing soft but did get aggressive through out in response to having to stand his ground while trying to get his answers out there. Biden was not entirely objective either. In my opinion it was Biden who was the first to sling accusations. The next debate, and I hope with a different moderator, will be interesting. The political analysist Rich Lowry wrapped it up well and appeared neutral, this is how NBC needs to behave.',

      "Dear Mr President, it concerns me when you state that Covid-19 has impacted the old population because they have heart problems and other comorbid conditions. I Believe that every life has a right to be protected, being it a person with 100 years, middle age, young and unborn. Discharging the responsibility to protect each life by attributing lost lives to age and presence of comorbid is morally wrong. We have an obligation to care for the aged with kindness, gentleness, love and compassion because their legacy is always which carries the future of a nation. I am also concerned about how you criticize the speech of former Vice President Mr. Joe Biden. Kindly remember in the Old testament, though Moses had difficulty in speech God Chose him and gave Him Heron to lead Israelites to promised land. You know very well by interrupting anybody who stammers in the midst of conversation you alter their thought process and you are using this as a weapon to make sure the Vice President can not articulate well his thoughts. Kindly be kind. I am praying to God that He will lead the path. I promise my support in prayers.",

My vote, as long as I am still entitled to one, will be for Trump, whose booming economy for ALL AMERICANS OF ALL COLORS, was only electively derailed by the China covid. I feel that the destruction of Trump's economy and almost immediate economic turn-around, was destroyed on purpose by Chinese release of Covid to destroy Trump's contindued win in all sections of society. It's likely the next best thing for China versus a shooting war, for which they appear to be preparing what with aircraft carriers and reclaiming atolls as military bases.  Covid is no accident!",

      'Praying for President Trump to continue leading our nation, but whomever wins this Nov., God is in control, according to Daniel chapter 2 (verse 21). There is so very much medical, and science evidence to prove, this virus was all planned, a government controlled takeover, to increase their riches, cause division/hate and depopulate our lands. Many won\'t listen, or believe, saying it\'s all another conspiracy theory. Check out "Event 201" from October last year, the United Nations and others, discussing a pandemic/economic crisis, to take control, devastate, and cause much fear. It\'s also very interesting to note, that all the US Presidents are related, to European, and Old Testament Kings, including Alexander the Great (articles below to prove). God has allowed Satan to rule most everywhere, including the government, churches, and schools. But God is ALWAYS in control, and even though those multi billionaires pulling the strings, like a puppet master, or puppeteer, according to the Bible, God\'s Word, because of too much wickedness, and sin, the end is near. Pray for Almighty God\'s mercy before it\'s too late, I pray for us always, every night, and every day.  Daniel 2:21, "And He changeth the times and the seasons: He removeth kings, and setteth up kings: He giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:"Jeremiah 10:12‚Äì13, "He hath made the earth by His power, He hath established the world by His wisdom, And hath stretched out the heavens by His discretion. When He uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, And He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; He maketh lightnings with rain, And bringeth forth the wind out of His treasures." Nahum 1:3 The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, And will not at all acquit the wicked: The LORD hath His way in the whirlwind and in the storm, And the clouds are the dust of His feet. Isaiah 29:6, "Thou shalt be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire." Psalm 121:1,2, "I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth." 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9, "And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels, In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His power;" Isaiah-Malachi, Matthew 24, Luke 21, Revelation 1-22.....all about these end times. Praying for God\'s mercy on all! https://amazingbibletimeline.com/blog/alexander-the-great-and-jerusalem/ https://imjustheretomakeyouthink.com/2017/03/11/genealogy-research-reveals-that-all-u-s-presidents-are-related-to-each-other-by-bloodline/',

Biden tried to have a civil debate, but Trump showed what a butt he truly is, not that anyone needed a reminder. He's been a simpering teething, toddler with a full diaper since the minute he's been in office. EVERY DAY, people, EVERY HOUR he's displayed increasingly more narcicistic character flaws, tweeting turd after asinine turd from what was once  a \"presidential\" bully pulpit. There's nothing \"presidential \" about him. We've let the devil in the sanctuary. The man lacks even a crumb of decency or self- control. Is it  any wonder that the whole country has collapsed into a ball of confusion, chaos and mayhem? Look at our leader! Trump is the actual virus! ANY sane, sensible, functioning adult with a heart is the antidote. VOTE HIM OUT!",

      "Donald Trump is nothing but a spoiled brat, who is a grade A bully. We don't tolerate children with bullying so why should tolerate a president who bullies. Trump had no right to attack Bidens son, even if what he said is true or false, Bidens son served his country and we all know how hard it is for both men and women who come back to a civilian life, it can be a difficult transition, a lot of them have permanent mental health issues because of what they had to do or witnessing horrible attacks, seeing those things gives them nightmares for the rest of their lives and who honestly could say that they could deal with that. Trump used Bidens son to bully Biden, not what they were there for. Biden should win, look at all the hate Trump and his supporters spreads. Trump likes to pour fuel onto fires, he likes to escalate the violence and hate. Trump has let down his country, during this global epidemic in downgrading the virus and spreading ridiculous theories, claiming whatt he thinks could cure the virus, a good example, inject bleach. This Trump is a joke and the world sees him that way. Trump is a immature little brat who has tantrums and then bullies people who he doesn't like. America needs to kick his sad butt out of the White House and get someone in who can be mature and level headed, someone who can make decisions that benefits the good people of this once beautiful country. Because right now its laying in ruins because of this president.",

      'I\'d like to congratulate the fine "folks" in the intelligence community who\'ve been working diligently to destabilize our nation from within and make way for DAVOS rule. Joe was a perfect pick and this will be a huge success.   Once the "embarrassment" and "disgrace" narratives play out, I\'m sure a good portion of populace will believe "we need a new political system".And to all my brothers and sisters in the intelligence community, I too was seduced into service at a young age. I know the torment of living outside the law. I know about the darkness that invades the soul as the job slowly erodes your soul and robs you of your humanity. I know how the job demands everything from you and steals any hope of ever knowing love. I know about the fear of wanting to leave and that last acquiescence of "I\'ll never be able to". And I also know that, whatever death and destruction is dealt from your hands, it can never compare to the torment you inflict on yourselves. I found a way to get your soul back and sleep in peace without medication! I love all of you who have to deal in destruction as I once did and I know what it\'s like to work with the demons. But I\'m here to tell you. You can get your soul back. You can have and know love again. Just ask.',

Now Trump argues that racial sensitivity is racist, meanwhile Biden argues that it prevents racism. Fact: the racial sensitivity training was only proposed to be ended THIS MONTH. How long have we been dealing with police brutality? We learn tonight that all this time while we have had racial sensitivity training in place, there has been police brutality! That speaks for itself. People argue that the police system needs to be reformed. This is that reform! The fear of racism is what keeps racism alive. Teaching about a "superior race" implies that there is an inferior race, thus it is racist! Trump\'s law & order is not to be blamed for police brutality, law & order is a response to reckless riots. Removing racial sensitivity training solves the police brutality issue that prompted these riots! Now Biden, an educated man, otta be able to make sense of this!',

Not someone to just cower down. All of these ppl are just trying to make trump look like crap. I never liked trump until recently.  He doesnt take crap or lies without taking care of it, and ending it. Biden is going to bring socialism to America so let's hope he doesnt win. If that happens we are not going to be free that's for sure.",

All those who vote for him and support him are also monstrous and inhuman. they are proud to have made slaves of Africans and to have plundered their continent, they are not ashamed of it. And in white supremacist there is neither black, nor yellow, nor any color other than white. So your turn will come to suffer or it will be the turn of your children, so I guess you have no plans to have children and you have no compassion for any child that is not white. And I'm not talking about the collateral damage, about all those white men, women, and children who are going to suffer even if they vote for him.",

She has a very balanced perspective on things that actually fits mostly everyone‚Äôs real feelings.  Most people are not extreme left or right.  Why not break this weird cycle and shake things up.These two ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù candidates have shown everyone their true colors including your Congress.  How long are you going to allow these people to play you and play with you?  To cause division? When is enough enough.

Careful where you ‚Äúcast‚Äù your energy to should you decide to vote and align your energy with this.Don‚Äôt let this society and this system socialize you into hatred and division.   They would rather debate than actually making sure the public knows what they stand for and what their agenda is.  This is election is so bad, that they‚Äôre not focusing on any issues.

      "I'm new to this whole NBC stuff but I gotta say this about Chuck Todd's assessment. One of the things that he claims that the left says about Trump is that he has no plans. It's funny because I heard those same words come out of Bidens mouth many times during this debate, yet every time Trump was asked what his plans were, he never once failed to deliver a worthy answer. Namely with his plans for COVID-19. He said that the vaccine is coming soon, I say we see what happens. If we wanna call fraud on him, let's do that once the vaccine fails to release, if it comes on time, you can't say he doesn't have plans. At least not with dignity you can't. Chuck said that the right claims that Biden is a captive of the left, however he said that Biden may have cleared himself from those claims during this debate. Where? At the start of the debate, he claimed that he's a Democrat but then later he switched it up to say that he'd be a president for the democrats and the Republicans. This entire debate, Trump was behind the reigns and Biden was just strapped in along for the ride, he either did his best to preserve his far left beliefs or he would throw his fellow party members under the bus at times when he knew Trump had won, so tell me, who's the one without a plan? I don't think it's fair to cater to a side. If you want me to believe that we live in a free country with a true democracy then I think I deserve news that is fair and unbiased. These news reporters use their stations as a platform to push their own opinions and agendas and I'd bet the money I had that you couldn't get the job unless you had the appropriate beliefs for the station. It's disgusting. We deserve better than that.",

Two minutes to answer serious possibly life altering questions for 350 million citizens is utter nonsense.  They're desperate squeeze in words in 120 seconds.  Sit them down and give them water and coffee...then drill them for 4-5 hours if u want to give them an honest opportunity to convey their opinions.  And with that much time to talk, guarantee you'll learn a whole lot more than what their opinions are about specific topics.  Americans want the cliff notes, headlines and not to be too bothered with long form discussions.  This format and two party junk is archaic, polarizing and closed minded.",

On the overall I think America is going so very low with these school children level debates where no respect no basic civilities applied it s frightening. Truly, did you guys learn something about each contender' program,intentions and policies once in office? I didn't. The only thing I would recall is that Trump can't listen and have the decency to let his opponent speak. He is a fast talker while Joe needs time to express himself and there is nothing wrong with the later even for a President.",

      "There are some things that need to be addressed in both camps. Chris works for Fox Network which is part of the Disney Media Corp. His hands are forever tied. President Trump should hold his reins a little tighter. Tonight you could see Biden fighting himself to keep focused. President Trump was getting under his skin. Like the blonde antelope, all he needs to do is wait on him. Once he breaks,  hold him out so he can't collect his thoughts. I know this would be a kind of torture but the Dems has been focusing on breaking this country apart from the beginning. Nothing wrong with giving him some of the same medicine, they've given this nation. You all understand, if another Dem gets into the presidency America is going to pay the price. They have been planning this for years.BTW, does any of you think there is a race problem in this country? I remember the 60s south and compare those years to now. Someone needs to show me where the systemic racism lies. I keep hearing this being used but I can't find it. That was a system of racism where the laws around you made it legal to persecute people according to race, religion, color, and national origin. Where does laws like that exist in the U.S., today?",

      "You couldn‚Äôt have possibly chosen a better moderator than Chris Wallace.  Biden is doing well not getting antagonized as Trump keeps up the childish attacks, but he could do even better.  Let Trump melt down, make a fool of himself.Trump is like an angry drunk at a bar who was denied another drink because the bartender cut him off.  And the drink he ordered is more power.  He keeps repeating the same two or three arguments, eclipsed by the number of his personal attacks and self praise.Biden shows here as he has in the past, he‚Äôs a classic American leader, a President.  It is a sharp contrast with Trump who currently has the job, but isn‚Äôt doing it and isn‚Äôt capable of doing it.Suggestion for the next debate: When either candidate interrupts the other‚Äôs time, or the moderator‚Äôs, there should be a ten second penalty for every five awarded to the other.  If the interruption is one second, it should be counted as five and incur the ten second penalty.Last thirty minutes Trump had a total meltdown.  It did more to support Biden-Harris than anything Biden said.And at the very end, the First Lady very politely thanked Chris Wallace, then went to stand almost military like next to her husband; followed by Mrs. Biden, wearing a mask, giving her husband a hug, and when Trump saw that he gave his wife a pat on the back and held her hand for the cameras.FREE MELANIA!  Vote Biden - Harris.",

If you Google it-Biden's campaign was broke after the last Dem debate-then all of a sudden-he wins. So unfortunate-the party needs to implode and be forced to regroup. It is unfortunate.",

      "Were the ground rules of debate thoroughly explained and agreed to by these candidates?  This was disgraceful and very disorderly. Does Trump not realize that he does himself no service by repeatedly interrupting?  Does he hope he will wear out Biden to the extent that Biden will leave the stage in despair?  Has Trump ever had a notion of how a diplomatic and orderly explanation of his ideas and strategy, calmly and seriously, will enhance his image as a thoughtful, informed, and intelligent leader?  Even the commentators on this video seem to portray this as a wrestling match, a ‚Äúfight‚Äù, a matter of disorderly conduct.  I pity Chris Wallace as he had no means of control to keep this an informative and helpful event.  Going forward, the debate format MUST INCLUDE a three stage sequence of 1) initial reply by first candidate to moderator, 3 minutes, 2) reply from alternate candidate, 3 minutes, 3) rebuttal from first candidate, 1 minute.  If either candidate violates the ‚Äúno interruption‚Äù rule, or respect of the time rules, then the mic must be cut immediately on the one interrupting to allow the correct responder to be heard.  Arrogance is NEVER a good strategy to impress voters!!  Let‚Äôs hear your plans, and thoughts about the other candidate maybe, but being rude is very much a turn-off.  Don‚Äôt disappoint those of us who want to hear real substance!",

Neither candidate got to cross-examine the other and show their chops. Why weren't two partisan moderators present instead of one registered Democrat? Democracy has become so mechanical, controlled and sensationalized that it's disgusting.",

      "Trump only speaks in headline style slogans and statements... no critical thinking or in-depth analysis. No real substantive statements. When asked if he would ask white supremacists to back off he said, \"sure... but...\"  He wouldn't just say yes. The world is run by honest, ethical and decent diplomacy or else we have no future. Wallace couldn't control Trump. Biden could have brought up more having so much ammunition.  Biden won because the world is run by decent discussion. Renewable energy is the future - if we have a future. Trump is a racist fascist and grifter. Remember the 107 million from the inaugural funds that Trump wanted to keep? Trump said, \"That's my money!!\" and he was told it would be illegal to get that money to which Trump replied,  \"F**k The Law!!\"  and then fired the person who told him that. He then hired Chris Christie thinking then he could get at that money. I think I remember Ivanka got some of that money. But this was just dismissed and we moved on to other daily outrageous acts by Trump. This helps to show Trump's real intent (i.e., to loot all he can from any source in his reach). Congress should have pursued Trump's violation of the Emolluments Clause. It's not too late. In fact, it is incumbent on Congress to initiate another impeachment inquiry immediately.",

      "This was unwatchable, we had better debates in high school. Chris Wallace had no control, although I'm not sure any can control someone as off the rails crazy as trump.  What they need to do is to turn their mics off when it's not their turn to talk.  Trump kept interrupting just as he did to Hillary in 2016, Biden was more or less reacting to trumps side comments. It wasn't what I'd hoped. The questions were poorly asked. They seemed to accentuate the negative, instead of focusing on what your policy is and what you plan to do the questions always finished with and why should the people chose you instead of your rival  That was all they seemed to answer pointing out faults with each other instead of telling me what they plan to do. At least for the portion I watched. I couldn't stand the constant bickering I couldn't hear what they were saying just shouting and Chris Wallace saying Mr. President, Mr. President I changed channels.  Throw trump out unless you enjoy the most corrupt, incompetent, laughing stock of the world, our democracy crippled as he tries to become a dictator and is totally useless in an emergency, refusing to take responsibility when we sorely needed a leader it became state vs state and there still is no national plan on what to do even after 200,000 plus dead Americans. Vote like your life depends on it, it does, and get rid of the republican senators they are spineless hypocrites that will say and lie with ease when it serves their interests and those interests are often not shared with the majority of Americans but is with the majority of their billionaire donors.  Vote Blue The septic tank has overflowed at the White House.",

We don't need a power crazed person who does executive order one after the other. The time for presidents should end. The electoral college is a joke. It shouldn't be a popularity contest with false promises. Just a person who is qualified for the job and does it correctly not just crack jokes and leave empty promises. This isn't a reality show for your entertainment. This is reality and let's stop playing games and fix this nation before it's too late. End the presidency. End the status quo.",

Search an old man called THINK ABOUT IT. CHRIST SAID MANY WILL BE DECEIVED, IF AT ALL POSSIBLE  EVEN THE VERY ELECT.Revelation 13:14And he deceives those who dwell on the earth by those signs which he was granted to do in the sight of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who was wounded by the sword and lived.15He was granted power to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed.16He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads,17and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark orfn the name of the beast, or the number of his name.18Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666.REVELATION 14: 9Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, ‚ÄúIf anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand,10‚Äúhe himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.11‚ÄúAnd the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.‚Äù12Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.13Then I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, ‚ÄúWrite: ‚ÄòBlessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.‚Äô‚Äâ‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù says the Spirit, ‚Äúthat they may rest from their labors, and their works follow them.‚Äùhttps://youtu.be/tLoncFS9Gf8          THE POTENTIAL  MARK OF THE BEAST VACCINES (COMPANY CALLED MODERNA) MODIFIED RNA=  MOD E RNAHYGROGEL , LUCIFERASE , VACINATION WILL ALTER OUR RNA/DNA.

And it was given authority over every tribe, people, language and nation.8All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast‚Äîall whose names have not been written in the Lamb‚Äôs book of life, the Lamb who was slain from the creation of the world.9Whoever has ears, let them hear.10‚ÄúIf anyone is to go into captivity, into captivity they will go. If anyone is to be killed with the sword, with the sword they will be killed.‚Äù This calls for patient endurance and faithfulness on the part of God‚Äôs people.11Then I saw a second beast, coming out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb, but it spoke like a dragon.12It exercised all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been healed.13And it performed great signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to the earth in full view of the people.14Because of the signs it was given power to perform on behalf of the first beast, it deceived the inhabitants of the earth. It ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived.15The second beast was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed.16It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads,*FORCED VACCINES THAT GENTICALLY MODIFY OUR DNA AND HAVE LUCIFERASE TACKING TECHNOLOGY AND HYGROGEL TECHNOLOGY TO SCAN US AND KNOW OUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. 17so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.18This calls for wisdom.

      "America, if Trump remains in office (even if by the skin of his teeth through the Electoral College mechanism and his losing the popular vote by maybe 14 million votes this time, compared to 10 million last time), the USA‚Äôs catastrophic collapse will have been deservedly self-induced, and no one but Americans will be to blame for not going out to vote in large enough numbers to throw the piece of human waste that is Donald J Trump out of the White House.Vote!Always remember this: The MAJORITY of American citizens who voted in 2016, did so AGAINST Trump, by 10 million votes over Trump. The PLURALITY of American citizens who voted in 2016, did so FOR Hillary, by 3 million votes over Trump. Only the SECOND LARGEST MINORITY of American citizens who voted in 2016, did so FOR Trump, but then the Electoral College system *OVERRULED* the will of the American people, and made Trump president. In 2020, Trump must be made to lose by more than 14 million, otherwise the Electoral College will again overrule the will of the American people and he will remain president with an even greater deficit than last time. The US electoral system is broken. Every moral American citizen who is a Republican/Democrat/Independent and eligible to vote and wants Trump out of office, needs to vote for Biden, because there is no second-round of voting, nor is there a preferential instant-run-off voting system.Unfortunately the US electoral system is a two party system, with an Electoral College, and votes for third candidates are wasted, because the person with the second largest minority of votes became president in 2016.",
